# tuktuk-sass 0.3.0 (at the same time retains the liberation tuktuk)
### Simple (but powerful) RWD Framework converted to Sass - Compass (in its original flavor you find in https://github.com/soyjavi/tuktuk.git) - tuktuk created by @soyjavi

## Sass: Basic modification and understanding

You can learn more about SASS at:

[sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com)

Sass runs as a local GEM on your system. You can run `sass --watch lib/bootstrap.scss:bootstrap-2.2.2.css`

## Compass: Basic modification and understanding

[compass-style.com](http://compass-style.org/)

Compass runs as a local GEM on your system. You can run:
`$ gem update --system`
`$ gem install compass`
`$ compass create <myproject>`


## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
